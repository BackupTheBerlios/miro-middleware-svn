Test for the generalized RangeSensor interfaces.

Handy to verify range sensor problems.

Start the individual range sensor service. Then you can access the
RangeSensor interfaces directly via these small test program. It offers
a simple text interface for each method available within the
interface.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line (-MNC
<robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file. Additionally you
have to provide the sensor name (Sonar, Laser, Infrared etc.) as the
first commandline argument.
