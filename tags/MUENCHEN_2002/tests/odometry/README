Test for the general odometry interface.

Handy to verify the odometry interface stuff.

Start the robots odometry service. Normally contained within the
robots set of base services: <RobotType>Base. Then you can access the
Odometry interface directly via the small test program. It offers a
simple text interface for each method available within the interfaces.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line
(-MNC <robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file.
