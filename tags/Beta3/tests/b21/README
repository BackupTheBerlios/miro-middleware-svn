Tool for low level b21 testing.

- B21BaseTest tests the mcp board based synchro drive.
- B21ButtonTest tests the button service on the robot.
- B21StressBase tries to flood the mcp board with commands.
  This is easily possible and we did not yet find an ideal
  solution for this problem.
- B21SelfTest another lowlevel test...
