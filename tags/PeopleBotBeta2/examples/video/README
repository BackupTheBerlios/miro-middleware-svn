Example code for the Video interface.

- LogVideo: Tool for grabbing single frames up to the full video
  stream to disc.
- VideoLatency: Measuring the time the image needs from the lense
  of the camera till into the processes memory:

  This is an attempt to determine the latency between vidoe capture
  of the camera and video capture of the device driver.  When it is
  started it just prints the current time on the screen.  Recording
  the monitor by the camera and capturing the video with LogVideo in
  streaming mode one can compare the log file time in the name with
  the last time printed on the screen.

  It gives a rough estimate, but is by far not as accurate as a
  latency test should be.
