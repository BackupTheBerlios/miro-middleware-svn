A small set of example programs demonstrating the use of the GPS interface:

GpsPoll: Polls for GPS global position updates and displays them as soon
         as they come in.

GpsStream: Subscribes for any GPS notifications (including NMEA sentences
           that are listed in the nmeaDispatch configuration parameter) and
           displays their contents as soon as they are received.

CtGpsTest: Demonstrates the use of the specialized CtGps interface.
