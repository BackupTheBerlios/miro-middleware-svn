Test for the directed perception pantilt interfaces.

Handy to verify the dp pantilit stuff.

Start the DpPantil service (B21 only). Then you can access the
DpPanTilt interfaces directly via these small test program. It offers
a simple text interface for each method available within the
interface.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line
(-MNC <robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file.
