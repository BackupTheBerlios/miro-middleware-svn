Small tests for the video interface.

TestVideoClient stores a burst of images from the video service to disk,
measuring timings. Uses shared memory, so you must have the frame grabber on
the local machine.

TestRemoteVideoClient does similar, but retrieves the whole images' content.
Runs also on a distant machine but uses the network heavily. Images should be
downscaled.
