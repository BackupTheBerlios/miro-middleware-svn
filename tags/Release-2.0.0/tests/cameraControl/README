Test for the general CameraControl interface.

Handy to verify the CameraControl interface stuff.

Start the camera control service. Then you can access the camera control
interface directly via this small test program. It offers a simple text
interface for each method available within the interfaces.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line
(-MNC <robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file.
