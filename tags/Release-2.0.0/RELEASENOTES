We are pleased to announce version 2.0.0 of Miro.
 
It is our first official BerliOS hosted release.
The tag in the cvs repository is tags/Release-2.0.0.
You can obtain the sources with a simple:

svn checkout http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/miro-middleware/tags/Release-2.0.0

Tar archives and the manual are also available at our web site.

This is mostly a stability release. It is the snapshot of our current
repository, before we start a new development cycle. We will deprecate old 
platforms and clean up code, so we wanted to create an official version of the 
status quo first.
