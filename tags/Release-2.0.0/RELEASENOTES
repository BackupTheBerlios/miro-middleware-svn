We are pleased to announce version 2.0.0 of Miro.

It is our first official BerliOS hosted release. 
The tag in the cvs repository is tags/Release-2.0.0.
You can obtain the sources with a simple:

svn chekcout 

Tar archives and the manual are also available at our web site.

This is mostly a stability release. It is the snapshot of our current
repository, before we start a new development cycle. We will deprecate old
platforms and clean up code, so we wanted to create an official version of
the status quo first.
