Test for the standard Speech interface.

Handy to verify the speech stuff.

Start the Speech service. Then you can access the
Speech interfaces directly via these small test program. It offers
a simple text interface for each method available within the
interface.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line
(-MNC <robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file.
