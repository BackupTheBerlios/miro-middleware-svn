Test for the fusedRangeSensor interfaces.

Handy to verify range sensor problems and set fusion parameters.

Start the individual range sensor service(s) and the fusedRangeSensorService. 
Then you can access the FusedRangeSensor interface via this program. It offers
a simple text interface for each method available within the interface.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line (-MNC
<robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file. Additionally you
have to provide the sensor name (Fused) as the first commandline argument.
