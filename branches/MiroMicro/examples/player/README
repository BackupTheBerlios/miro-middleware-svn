Example configuration files for player and gazebo

pioneers.world is a gazebo world which contains two Pioneer2DX models; 
one with a SonyVID30 camera and
another with a SonyVID30 camera and a SICK laser scanner. There are also a cylinder and a box for the robots to play with.

pioneers.cfg is the player configuration file to use with the previous world. 
 It provides the player drivers for the Miro supported devices. 
 Instance 0 is the robot with laser scanner, and instance 1 the one without.

gazebo.cfg is a player configuration file for a single robot. It provides
 more drivers than the standard player gazebo.cfg file (it adds sonar, power, 
 camera and ptz) 

 For testing run this:
 
 > gazebo $MIRO/examples/pioneers.world
 
 > player $MIRO/examples/gazebo.cfg
 
 > cd $MIRO/bin/
 > ./PlayerBase -MCF $MIRO/examples/miroPlayer.xml
 
 > ./VideoService -MCF $MIRO/examples/miroPlayer.xml
