Test for the general gripper interface.

Handy to verify the gripper interface stuff.

Start the robots gripper service. Then you can access the gripper
interface directly via the small test program. It offers a simple text
interface for each method available within the interfaces.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line
(-MNC <robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file.
