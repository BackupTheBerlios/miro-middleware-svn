Tools for low level Sparrow99 robot testing.

- SparrowTest: Accesses directly the sparrow board without using the
  CORBA based interfaces. Usefull to narrow the cause of failure, in
  case the robot does not work properly.

   Offers a simple text interface for all of the sparrow board
   interface methods.

- KickerTest: Small test program for kicker testing. Provide the kicking
  time as first command line parameter and the robot will kick each time
  you press button 0 on the robot.

- PanPosition: Small test program to verify the pan timings.

Note that the tests have to be run on the box, the sparrow board is
attached to.
