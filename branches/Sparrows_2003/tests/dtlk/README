Test for the doubletalk speech card interfaces.

Handy to verify the speech stuff of the B21.

Start the DtlkSpeech service (B21 only). Then you can access the
Speech interfaces directly via these small test program. It offers
a simple text interface for each method available within the
interface.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line
(-MNC <robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file.
