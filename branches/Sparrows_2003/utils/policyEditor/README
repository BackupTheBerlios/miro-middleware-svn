Utility for behaviour/arbiter/actionpattern/policy editing.

Uses X.

This graphical editor lets you edit your behaviour configuration and
parameterization by a graphical frontend. Policies are specified by an
XML-file. As XML-Editing is not our favorite task, we build this
editor.

To use your own behaviours within the editor, you have to specify them
and their parameters in a PolicyEditor config file. An example is in 
the directory MIRO_ROOT/examples/behaviour.

Isn't it uncool, that you have to specify you behaviour parameters in
C++ as well as in XML? - Yes! We are working on it. The idea is, that
you specify it just in XML and the C++ code is auto generated. 

Note that as we do not have a plugin-architectur for the behaviour
stuff, you have to make sure, that all needed behaviours and arbiters
get instanciated and registered at the respective repositories. - Yes,
we are looking for voluteers to change that...
