\chapter{Introduction}

\miro is a distributed object oriented framework for mobile robot
control, based on CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
Architecture) \cite{OMG:CORBA-standart} technology. The \miro core
components have been developed in C++ for Linux. But due to the
programming language independency of CORBA further components can be
written in any language and on any platform that provides CORBA
implementations.

The \miro core components have been developed under the aid of ACE
(Adaptive Communications Environment) \cite{ACE-Paper, ACE-Manual}, an
object oriented multi-platform framework for OS-independent
interprocess, network and real time communication. They use TAO (The
ACE ORB) \cite{TAO-paper} as their ORB (Object Request Broker), a
CORBA implementation designed for high performance and real time
applications. Therefore \miro should be easily portable to any other
OS, where ACE and TAO run on.  These are many Unix clones, Windows NT
and some real time operating systems.

\miro is currently available for the RWI B21 platform, the Activmedia
Pioneer 1, and the \sparrow architecture developed at the University
of Ulm, we are convinced, that other ports can be done straight
forward.

\miro was built since the existing robot control architectures didn't
suffice our needs of usability, reliability, scalability and
portability.

We used C++ due to its advantages in big projects, since it was
especially designed for big projects. We have learned the hard way,
that this is a serious requirement, for projects like a mobile robot
control architecture.

We use multi processing, multithreading and the CORBA technology since
most robotics applications are inherently concurrent and distributed.
The hardware devices, like sensors and actuators run concurrently and
due to the constant lack of computing power especially in computer
vision, tend to reside on multiple computers. And as soon as
cooperative behavior of multiple autonomous robots is of interest, the
system as a whole is distributed anyways.

%We used an object oriented approach, since real live objects are
%concerned. And on the other hand, OO is just state of the art and you
%need good arguments to start a new project ignoring object
%orientation.

And last but not least we use ACE and TAO since these are multi
platform, high performance libraries which proved to be very
sophisticated in terms of usability, portability and scalability. ---
Additionally, they are open source libraries. They haven't
disappointed us yet, to the contrary.

\section{The \miro Group}

The \miro core developers are (in alphabetical order): 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Stefan Enderle
  \item Gerhard Kraetzschmar
  \item Gerd Mayer
  \item Stefan Sablatnög
  \item Steffen Simon
  \item Hans Utz
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation and Setup}

Ask your system administrator if there exists a central installation,
or whether it would be more convenient to prepare a central
installation. Prerequisites for installing \miro is that you have a
running QT (Version $>$ 2.2.x) as well as an ACE/TAO installation.

\subsection{ACE and TAO Installation}

ACE/TAO is a large software package with many configuration options
affecting the build process as well as its runtime features. Therfore
we summarize here our experience with the ACE/TAO installation.

At the time of this writing we suggest always to use the
latest beta of ACE/TAO instead of the latest stable version ---
currently 5.2.2/1.2.2. TAO is under rapid development and \miro
utilizes some of its latest features (like the CORBA Notification
Service).

The options that should be set additionally in the {\tt
  platform\_macros.GNU} file (to be found under
$<$ACE-directory$>$/include/makeinclude/) are the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tb]{}
debug=0
qt_reactor=1
\end{lstlisting}

Additionally, for memory footprint reduction you might also add the 
following:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tb]{}
DEFFLAGS=-DACE_USE_RCSID=0
ACE_COMPONENTS=FOR_TAO
\end{lstlisting}

If you want to build \miro only for a specific platform, insert the desired
name of one of the following supported platforms: B21, Pioneer1 or Sparrow99

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tb]{}
MIRO_COMPONENTS=B21
\end{lstlisting}

We also recommend to read the installation instructions provided
by ACE carefully. We admit, the installation isn't entirely trivial.

To compile and run programs that use the ACE/TAO toolkit, also the
environment variables {\tt ACE\_ROOT} and {\tt TAO\_ROOT} need
to be set to the appropriate root directories of your ACE/TAO
installation. For the bash shell the following lines in your local
{\tt .bashrc} file should do the job:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tb]{}
export ACE_ROOT=<path to the ACE directory>
export TAO_ROOT=$ACE_ROOT/TAO
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ACE_ROOT/ace/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
\end{lstlisting}
%%$

Note that if you use a non-standard Qt installation, also the
environment variable \texttt{QTDIR} has to point to the correct
installation directory of the Qt library.


\subsection{\miro installation}

\miro additionally needs the environment variable MIRO\_ROOT to be set
to the appropriate root directory of your \miro installation.  The
variable MIRO\_LOG indicates the directory where log-files are stored
automatically.  For the bash shell once again add the following lines
to your {\tt .bashrc} file:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tb]{}
export MIRO_ROOT=<path to Miro>
export MIRO_LOG=<path to log directory>
export QTDIR=<path to qt>= 2.3>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MIRO_ROOT/lib/:$LD_LIBARAY_PATH
\end{lstlisting}

After that, change to the \miro root directory and type {\tt make}. There
is no additional configuration needed, as the configuration of ACE
(compiler settings etc.) is inherited in the makefiles of \miro.


\section{\miro Directory Structure}

\miro comes with the full source code and documentation as well as a
set of test programs and examples that should facilitate your first
steps when writing your own programs. To help you navigate through the
directory tree of a \miro distribution, we give a brief overview of
the directories present in the \miro root directory:

\begin{description}
\item[bin:]
  This directory contains links to the binaries of \miro.
  For an explanation of the individual binaries, see Chapter
  \ref{sec:services} about the robot services.
\item[doc:]
  Here, the available documentation is gathered. In the
  subdirectory {\tt tex} you find the postscript version of this
  manual and in the directory {\tt html} resides the auto generated
  online documentation of all \miro classes and their methods
  (the starting page of this documentation resides at: \\
  {\tt \$MIRO\_ROOT/doc/html/idl/index.html} respectivly \\
  {\tt \$MIRO\_ROOT/doc/html/cpp/index.html}).
\item[etc:]
  Config files for the individual robots.
\item[examples:]
  Examples on how to use individual interfaces of \miro. If you want
  to write your own programs utilizing the \miro framework, this is a
  good place to look for inspirations.
\item[idl:]
  The IDL sources of the CORBA interfaces and data types.
\item[performance-tests:]
  Some tests that measure the performance of \miro's
  services. --- Not too much there at the moment.
\item[scripts:]
  Utilities for source code formatting and handling sequences of
  datafiles.
\item[src:]
  Here, all sources of the \miro services reside. New services for
  further robot platforms should go in here.
\item[templates:]
  Templates for Makefiles and the headers for source files. Copy the
  corresponding template, if you want to start a new subproject within
  the \miro source hierarchy. If you start your own new project on top
  of \miro, the Makefile templates might still be useful for you. They
  handle all the stuff concerning ACE/TAO and the multi-platform build
  process. See Chapter \ref{sec:makefile} for details.
\item[tests:]
  Small test programs to monitor or test isolated interfaces of the
  \miro robot control architecture.
\item[utils:]
  Utilities made for convenience. No magic to be expected here.
