Test for the generalized motion interfaces.

Handy to verify the motor controler stuff.

Start the robots motion service. Then you can access the motion
interfaces directly via these small test programs. They offer a simple
text interface for each method available within the interfaces.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line
(-MNC <robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file.
