Test for the Sphinx/Festival Speech interfaces.

Handy to verify the speech stuff.

Start the SphinxSpeech service. Then you can access the
Speech interfaces directly via these small test program. It offers
a simple text interface for each method available within the
interface.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line
(-MNC <robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file.
