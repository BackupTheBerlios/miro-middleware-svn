Tool for low level pioneer board testing.

Accesses directly the pioneer board without using the CORBA based
interfaces. Usefull to narrow the cause of failure, in case the robot
does not work properly.

Offers a simple text interface for most of the pioneer board interface
methods. - Should actually offer access to all pioneer board interface
methods...
