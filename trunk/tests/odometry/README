Test for the general odometry interface.

Handy to verify the odometry interface stuff.

Start the robots odometry service. Then you can access the odometry
interface directly via the small test program.It offers a simple
text interface for each method available within the interfaces.

Don't forget to specify the robots name at the command line
(-MNC <robotname>), if it is set in the configuration file.
