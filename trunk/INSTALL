Basic Installation
==================

This software package depends heavily on ACE and TAO. Therefor its
installation instructions are simmilar to that package. If you already
installed ACE and TAO, the installing instructions should sound
familiar to you.

The libraries Miro depends on are ACE (>= 5.2), TAO (>= 1.2) and
qt (>= 2.3). These should be installed first. The environment
variables ACE_ROOT, TAO_ROOT, QTDIR and LD_LIBRARY_PATH should be set
accoringly.

Now. Set the environment variable MIRO_ROOT to the base directory of
your Miro directory tree (/usr/local/Miro for example) and add
$MIRO_ROOT/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Switch to the directory $MIRO_ROOT and simply call make.

Note: The build process of Miro recycles the Makefiles of
ACE. Therefor the options specified in platform-macros.GNU also apply
to Miro. Some of the submakes of miro try to override the defaults for
some ACE build flags like >debug< or >optimize<. If you want to allow
them to do so, you should write your changes in platform-macros.GNU
like following. Instead of

debug = 1

write

ifeq (,$(optimize))
  optimize = 1
endif

The documentation is not built automatically. To do so, switch to
$MIRO_ROOT/doc and call make again. Note that to build the
documentation, doxygen, latex and fig2dev are needed.

If not all robot platforms need to be supported, the relevant
platforms can be specified in the build variable

MIRO_COMPONENTS

the component names are:

B21 Pioneer1 Sparrow99

Set the variable in $MIRO_ROOT/include/makeinclude/miro.macros.GNU or
simple in the $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU file.
