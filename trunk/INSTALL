Basic Installation
==================

This software package depends heavily on ACE and TAO. Therefor its
installation instructions are similar to that package. If you already
installed ACE and TAO, the installing instructions should sound
familiar to you.

The libraries Miro depends on are ACE (>= 5.2), TAO (>= 1.2) and qt
(>= 2.3). These should be installed first. The environment variables
ACE_ROOT, TAO_ROOT, QTDIR and LD_LIBRARY_PATH should be set
accordingly. Qt is installed on most Unix systems anyway, since KDE
relies on it.

Now. Set the environment variable MIRO_ROOT to the base directory of
your Miro directory tree (/usr/local/Miro for example) and add
$MIRO_ROOT/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Switch to the directory $MIRO_ROOT and simply call make.

Note: The build process of Miro recycles the Makefiles of
ACE. Therefor the options specified in platform-macros.GNU also apply
to Miro. Some of the submakes of Miro try to override the defaults for
some ACE build flags like >debug< or >optimize<. If you want to allow
them to do so, you should write your changes in platform-macros.GNU
like following. Instead of

debug = 1

write

ifeq (,$(optimize))
  optimize = 1
endif

The documentation is not built automatically. To do so, switch to
$MIRO_ROOT/doc and call make again. Note that to build the
documentation, doxygen, latex and fig2dev are needed.

If not all robot platforms need to be supported, the relevant
platforms can be specified in the build variable

MIRO_COMPONENTS

the component names are:

B21 Pioneer1 Sparrow99

Set the variable in $MIRO_ROOT/include/makeinclude/miro.macros.GNU or
simple in the $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU file.

Supported platforms:

- The B21 port is the oldest one and should therefore be the most
  stable, regarding the interfaces. All of the robots hardware
  components are supported by Miro.

- The Sparrow99 robots are our soccer robots. They are our
  testbed for multi-robot programming. Therefore most new technology
  is first tested on this platform. - So even as you do not have a
  Sparrow99 robot (we built them ourselfs), it might be interesting
  to look at the sources for this robot if you are looking for group
  communication technology etc.

- The Pioneer1 platform is a complete port for the ActiveMedia robot
  series, based on the PSOS, P2OS and AROS protocols. But we could only
  test and extend it to the platforms available to us. 

  * The old Pioneer1 is supported, but lacks maintenance, as our model 
    is not used at the lab anymore.
  * The Performance PeopleBot is in active development and already
    mostly complete. Motors, Sonars, Bumpers and Video are working.
    PanTilt and Gripper are experimental, Zoom is to come next.
