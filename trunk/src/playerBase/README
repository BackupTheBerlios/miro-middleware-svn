This is a Player interface for Miro.

It needs a running instance of Player and provides Miro services for some of 
 the player devices. Currently offered services are:
Odometry
Motion
Stall
Laser
Sonar
Battery
PanTilt

Video is included as a device in src/video

If a device is not supplied by Player, it will issue a warning and not provide
 the Miro service; other services should be unnaffected. The only required
 Player device is position. Should it not be available, PlayerBase will end
 with error. It doesn't make any sense a robot without odometry or movement
 in Miro, does it?

FAQ

configure says "Player support disabled" even though --enable-Player was used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The header files for player were not found on the standard include paths.
Try pointing the environment variable PLAYER_ROOT to your player installation
 directory ("--prefix" used when configuring player)


How to run a single simulated robot on a single computer
--------------------------------------------------------
(Based on gazebo-0.51 and Player-1.6.2)

-Run gazebo
(gazebo/bin> gazebo ../share/gazebo/worlds/example.world)
-Run Player
(player/bin> player -g 0 $MIRO_ROOT/examples/player/gazebo.cfg)
-Run PlayerBase
(Miro/bin> PlayerBase)
-Run the desired Miro clients
(Miro/bin> QtTouchpad)
(Miro/bin> OdometryStream)


How to run a single simulated robot on different computers
----------------------------------------------------------

-Run gazebo 
(gazebo/bin> gazebo ../share/gazebo/worlds/example.world)
-Run Player on the same computer
(player/bin> player -g 0 $MIRO_ROOT/examples/player/gazebo.cfg)
-Run PlayerBase on another computer
(Miro/bin> PlayerBase -h PlayerHostname -p PlayerPort)
-Run the desired Miro clients
(Miro/bin> PanTiltTest)
(Miro/bin> QtVideo)


How to run many simulated robots
--------------------------------
-Run gazebo (one instance with all robots within)
(gazebo/bin> gazebo $MIRO_ROOT/examples/player/pioneers.world)
-Run Player (one instance with all robots within)
(player/bin> player $MIRO_ROOT/examples/player/pioneers.cfg)
-Run PlayerBase for the first robot
(Miro/bin> PlayerBase -MNC robot1)
-Run PlayerBase for the second robot
(Miro/bin> PlayerBase -MNC robot2 -i 1)
[Use a different naming context ("robot2") and connect to the second instance
 of the player devices ("-i 1"; first is 0)]
-Run the desired Miro clients
(Miro/bin> QtTouchPad -MNC robot1)
(Miro/bin> QtTouchPad -MNC robot2)

There are of course other possibilities; such as running each PlayerBase on a different computer, using two separate player instances for each robot (e.g. on different ports), ...
